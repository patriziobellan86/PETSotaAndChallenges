In this file we report where we tracked the process elements and process relations out from this framework

- 'def processafrase'
    We extracted 'Actor' PET process element from the '<ACTOR>' tag
    We extracted 'Activity' PET process element from the '<ACTION>' tag
    We extracted 'Activity Data' PET process element from the '</PARAMETER>' tag

    We created a 'Uses' relation between the Activity and the Activity data extracted
    We created a 'Actor Performer' relation between the Activity and the Actor extracted

-  at the end.
    We assume a sequential relation between activity. So we created a 'Flow' relation between activities.
