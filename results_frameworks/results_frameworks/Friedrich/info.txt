In this file we report where we tracked the process elements and process relations out from this framework


- 'ProcessModelBuilder.createProcessModel'
    We extracted 'Activity' PET process element from action.f_name.

    'Activity Data'  form action.f_object and the 'Uses' relation
    'Actor' from action.f_actorFrom and the 'Actor Performer' relation

	'Further specification' from action.f_specifiers and the 'Further Specification' relation

	Since we were not able to extract gateway and correctly capture the 'flow' relation we excluded it.

We were not able to parse text 'doc-3.6' due to the following error:
"""
/Users/patrizio/texts/doc-3.6.txt
Sentence contains no action?!?
