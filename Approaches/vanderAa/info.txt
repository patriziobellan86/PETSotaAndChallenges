In this file we report where we tracked the process elements and process relations out from this framework

- 'ResultsWriter/ResultsWriter.java/write'
    We recorded 'Activity' from dc.getActionB().getVerb()
    We recorded 'Activity Data' from  dc.getActionB().object
    We recorded 'Actor' from dc.getActionB().subject

    Then, we created the 'Uses' and 'Actor Performer' relations for each activity

    We excluded the 'Flow' relation since this framework generate declarative relation.
