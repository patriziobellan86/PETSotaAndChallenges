In this file we report where we tracked the process elements and process relations out from this framework

from:
- 'def create_activities'
    We extracte the 'Activity' PET element from the list of verbs
    We extracted the 'Activity Data' PET element from the final_objs
    We capture the 'Uses' relation between them.

- 'def ParseData'
    We captured the 'Flow' relation between activities.
