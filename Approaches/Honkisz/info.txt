In this file we report where we tracked the process elements and process relations out from this framework

from:
- 'def add_sequence_flow'
    We extracted 'Activity' and 'Activity Data' PET process elements and their 'Uses' relation.
    We extracted 'Activity' and 'Actor' PET process elements and their 'Actor Performer' relation.
    We also extracted the 'Flow' relation between Activity.

- 'def add_conditional_gateway_branch'
    We extracted 'XOR gateway' and 'Condition Specification' PET process elements.
    We extracted 'Flow' and 'Same Gateway' relations.

- 'def add_default_flow_to_conditional_gateway'
    We extracted 'XOR gateway' PET process element and  'Flow' and 'Same Gateway' relations.

- 'def add_parallel_gateway_branch'
    We extracted 'Activity' and 'Activity Data' PET process elements and their 'Uses' relation.
    We extracted 'Activity' and 'Actor' PET process elements and their 'Actor Performer' relation.
    We also extracted the 'Flow' relation between Activity.
